# Grading Rubric for Assignment #2

Please include your name at the top of the submitted notebook.

**Important:** Your notebooks should be a polished finished product. See
the [assignment guidelines](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/assignment/overview.html#guidelines)
for more info.

## Requirements

- **1 Matplotlib chart** (of any type)
  - You should consider what aspect of the dataset might be best plotted using matplotlib.
  - Include your reasoning for using matplotlib to visualize this specific aspect of the data.
  - You will be graded on the aesthetics of the plot, namely, color choices and clarity.
- **1 seaborn chart** (of any type)
  - Please include the motivation behind your choice for the type of seaborn plot used and why.
- **3 altair plots**
  - **Both** of the following techniques should be used at least once:
    - A transformation (mean, count, binning, etc)
    - Brush selection
- A short discussion (a few sentences) of the main conclusion of each chart
  (in a markdown cell below each chart). It does not need to be interesting or insightful,
  but it is good practice to always note the main conclusions so the notebook make sense after time passes.
- **Extra credit:**: 2-chart altair dashboard,
  - This should be **in addition to** the 3 charts above
  - Filtering on one chart should cross-filter the other chart (via `transform_filter()`)

**Important:** Your notebooks should be a polished finished product. For example:

- please remove any extra or unneccesary code.
- please try to use markdown cells with section headers to mark different sections of the analysis.

## Rubric

You will be graded on the following areas:

- Have the technical requirements (see above) been met?
- The aesthetics of the visualizations, e.g., color choices, clarity, labeling, etc.
- For the seaborn and matplotlib plots, did you try to match visualization type with the best library and explain the motivation behind your choice?

## Points

- Matplotlib plots: 8 points
- Seaborn plots: 8 plots
- Altair plots: 20 points
- Explanations / descriptive text: 4 points
- Extra credit: 2 points

**Total points: 40 points**
