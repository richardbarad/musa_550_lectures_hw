This project was completed by Richard Barad!

I aimed to fulfill the following requirments:

1) Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).
2) It combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.
3) The analysis of the data is reasonably complex, involving multiple steps (geospatial joins/operations, data shaping, data frame operations, etc).
